# ReactJS
In React.js, a component is a reusable piece of code that defines the structure and behavior of a UI element. Components in React can be thought of as building blocks that can be combined to create complex user interfaces.

There are two types of components in React:

1.Functional components: These are stateless components that are defined as functions and take in props (short for properties) as arguments and return JSX (a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows us to write HTML-like code in our JavaScript code).

2.Class components: These are stateful components that are defined as classes and have a state object that can be updated. They also have lifecycle methods that allow us to hook into different stages of the component's lifecycle.
